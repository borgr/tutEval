<!-- # What to expect in the evaluation tutorial -->

This guide covers all of [my](https://ktilana.wixsite.com/leshem-choshen) meta-findings. I should mention my expertise: NLP and Machine Learning (Computer Science), and Why do I mention it? because postdocs are very individual and fields and origin countries (Israel) may alter some of the suggestions.

Now, you're probably thinking, "There must be better guides out there." I hope you are right, share them or add here the best tips you found! Let's make it epic, for us all.
